    "# CSV File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll cover how to bring data in and out of a `python` program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many scientific instruments and software will output what are called \"comma separated value\" files, or `.csv`s.\n",
    "These `.csv` files are usually structed like a table, with the type of data in the first row, or the header of the file, and values for each measurement in subsequent rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the provided file, `example_data.csv`, and you should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "|t, |x, |y, |z  |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "|0, |0, |0, | 0 |\n",
    "|1, |1, |2, | 1 |\n",
    "|2, |2, |4, | 4 |\n",
    "| ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ | ⋮ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you'll know what kind of data the columns are supposed to represent according to their names (e.g. `t`, `x`, `y`, `z`).\n",
    "In this case, we'll say that the `t` column correpsonds to the time of each measurement of the (`x`, `y`, `z`) positions of some particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we'll want to bring this data into `python` to be able to work with it a bit more.\n",
    "To do so, we will use some functions provided by the `numpy` package."
